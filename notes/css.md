## Quiz
<!-- 
* Why are we using public for only one class?

    <details>
    <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Solution</summary>
    It is how it has been designed and I am not sure if the reason is  documented. But here is a good reason on why it is done that way. Let's  assume we have two public classes Y & Z in a  file named Y.java.  Now, let's assume a different class X is using Z.  Now, when we compile  X, the compiler first tries to locate Z.class and if it cannot find it,  then it tries to locate Z.java so that it can compile it automatically.  But, since we only have Y.java, the class Z  cannot be located and hence  we get a compilation error. So, we do need  to place them in separate  files.
