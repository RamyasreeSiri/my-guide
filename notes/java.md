### Java - a High level overview

#### What is Java ?

A General purpose(not dependent on any domain, can be used to develop wide variety of applications), object-oriented(helps real world scenarios), platform independent(write once and run anywhere), concurrent(multi-threading) programming language that runs very fast.

Assembly Language ----> assembler ----> Machine language
Source code(High level languages) ----> Compiler ----> target language

#### Compiler

**Compilation** -> Converting of sourcecode to target language(machine code, byte code, programming lanugage),

1. it verifies syntax and semantics
2. Code optimization
3. Generates machine code

source code ---> [compiler] ---> machine code ---> [CPU] ---> results

Pros                   | Cons
:----                  | :----
Fast execution         | No platform independence
No compilation step       | Interpreter is loaded into the memory
Easier to update |

#### Interpreter

**Interpretation** -> Directly executing source code to get results

1. Its a virtual machine that simulates a CPU
2. It executes pre-compiled machine code in its library for each command in the language, it doesn't generate machine code.

source code ---> [Interpreter] ---> results

Pros                         | Cons
:----                        | :----
Platform independence        | Slow, costly memory access, Source code is reinterpreted every time
No compilation step          | Interpreter is loaded into the memory
Easier to update             |

> Java uses compilation for fast execution and interpretation for platform independence.

Java Source code --> [Java compiler] --> Java bytecode --> [Java interpreter] --> result

* JVM is the Java interpreter we use,
* JVM is platform specific or dependent which helps in achieving platform independence.
* Java bytecode is platform independent

> Java is a interpreted language as we are using JVM to interpret the Java byte code

**Commands used for compilation and interpretation of JAVA**
Java source code, `Hello.java` --> compile using `javac Hello.java` --> output is `Hello.class` (java bytecode) --> JVM executes it in any platform using `java Hello`

##### Execution speed of JVM

* Java bytecode is compact, compiled, and optimized which is Designed for JVM, and JVM interpretation of Java bytecode is much faster.

* Just-in-time(JIT) compilation by JVM.

'Hello world' program in Java

```java

public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World~");
  }
}
```
